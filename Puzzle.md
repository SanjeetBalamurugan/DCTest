You are designing puzzle ideas for a narrative-driven game with the theme **“Chain Reaction.”**  

### Core Concept
- Puzzle game focused on **cause-and-effect** where each action triggers the next in a sequence.  
- Players must solve logic and physics-based challenges by figuring out the correct order of events.  
- The game features an **MC** (main character) who enters a ruined Mayan-inspired ancient portal to seek a powerful artifact.  
- Early in the story, the MC meets a mysterious girl who gives them:  
  1. An **Ancient Device** (can interact with mechanisms, rewind/queue triggers, or link events).  
  2. A **Bow that shoots elemental arrows** (Fire, Water, Earth, Air).  

### Setting
- **Levels 1–5:** Outside the temple ruins (teaching phase). Mystical ancient courtyards, overgrown ruins, ritual sites.  
- **Levels 6–10:** Inside the temple (mastery phase). Heavily Mayan-inspired architecture, murals, mirrors, rotating gears, elemental statues.  

### Puzzle Requirements
- Each puzzle must:  
  1. Use **cause-and-effect chain reactions** (one event triggers the next).  
  2. Incorporate **elemental interactions** (fire, water, earth, air).  
  3. Include **sequential logic** (order matters).  
  4. Have **interactive environmental elements** (mirrors, cranks, levers, movable blocks, ropes, gears, etc.), not just arrow shooting.  
  5. Gradually **increase in complexity** across 10 levels.  

### Examples of Puzzle Styles
- **Light puzzles (like Assassin’s Creed):** rotate mirrors/prisms to redirect beams.  
- **Physics puzzles:** rolling boulders, floating logs, swinging bridges.  
- **Timing puzzles:** activate windmills or platforms in rhythm.  
- **Balance puzzles:** maintain fire/water equilibrium, align weights or gears.  
- **Combination puzzles:** require multiple elements in precise order.  

### Deliverable
Provide **10 level-specific puzzle concepts** (5 outside + 5 inside) that:  
- Match the setting progression.  
- Introduce mechanics gradually (start simple, end complex).  
- Blend bow abilities, device mechanics, and interactive environmental puzzles.  
- Emphasize **fun chain reactions** and **critical sequencing**.  

Output format:  
- **Level Name & Setting**  
- **Core Mechanic(s)**  
- **Puzzle Description** (step-by-step cause-and-effect chain)  
- **Key Interactivity** (what player manipulates aside from arrows)  
- **Complexity Goal** (learning, intermediate, or mastery)
